# Universal Game Gesture Controls: control characters, cars, horses using hands in Games

## 🎮👋🚗🐴

This project uses the Python OpenCV module to detect hand gestures and control characters, cars, and horses in any videogame. By using computer vision techniques, the program captures the movements of the user's hand and translates them into corresponding actions in the game. This allows the user to control the characters, drive cars, ride horses, and perform other actions simply by moving their hand in front of the camera.
